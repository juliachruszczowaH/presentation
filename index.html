					<img src="examples/assets/documentstore.png" alt="Document store">
					<aside class="notes">
						MongoDB works on concept of collection and document. A database provides a container for storing
						and organizing data. Each database contains one or more collections, and each collection
						contains zero or more documents.
						A database can contain multiple collections, but a collection cannot span multiple databases.
						Likewise, a collection can contain multiple documents, but a document cannot span multiple
						collections.

						Documents contain dynamic schema. It means documents in a collection can contain different set
						of fields and there is no type limitation for the fields. We can add any type of data in a
						field. Document is a set of key-value pairs.
						Documents are represented in binary encoded format called BSON (similar to JSON). This BSON
						implementation supports embedding objects and arrays within other objects and arrays.

					<aside class="notes">
						Looking at how data is stored, we’ve already touched some of features:
						- Document oriented database
						- MongoDB is a schema-less database. That means we can have any type of data in a separate
						document. This thing gives us flexibility and a freedom to store data of different types.
						- Ad-hoc Queries - MongoDB supports field, range queries, regular expression searches. Queries
						can return specific fields of documents and also include user-defined JavaScript functions.

					<h4 style="color:#1a6091">Replication</h4>
					<img src="examples/assets/replication.png" alt="Replication">
					<aside class="notes">
						Replication is the process of synchronizing data across multiple servers. MongoDB achieves
						replication by the use of replica set. A replica set is a group of mongod instances that host
						the same data set. In a replica, one node is primary node that receives all write operations.
						All other instances, such as secondaries, apply operations from the primary so that they have
						the same data set. Replica set can have only one primary node. Client application always
						interact with the primary node and the primary node then replicates the data to the secondary
						nodes.

					<h4 style="color:#1a6091">Sharding</h4>
					<img src="examples/assets/sharding.png" alt="Sharding">
					<aside class="notes">
						The major and very common problem with a growing web application is scaling. To overcome this,
						MongoDB has come up with Sharding feature. It is one of the greatest key features of MongoDB.
						Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to
						support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations. Sharding makes it
						possible to provide horizontal scalability. Horizontal scaling (referred as sharding also) is a
						complicated process and is done using several machines or shards. Each shard holds a portion of
						the data and functions as a separate database. The collection of several shards together is what
						forms a single logical database. The operations are performed through services called query
						routers, App server and configuration servers which decide which operation needs to be routed to
						which shard.

					<aside class="notes">
						a. Flexible Database
						We know that MongoDB is a schema-less database. That means we can have any type of data in a
						separate document. This thing gives us flexibility and a freedom to store data of different
						types.
						b. Sharding
						We can store a large data by distributing it to several servers connected to the application. If
						a server cannot handle such a big data then there will be no failure condition. The term we can
						use here is “auto-sharding”.
						c. High Speed
						MongoDB is a document-oriented database. It is easy to access documents by indexing. Hence, it
						provides fast query response. The speed of MongoDB is 100 times faster than the relational
						database.
						d. High Availability
						MongoDB has features like replication and gridFS. These features help to increase data
						availability in MongoDB. Hence the performance is very high.
						e. Scalability
						A great advantage of MongoDB is that it is a horizontally scalable database. When you have to
						handle a large data, you can distribute it to several machines.
						f. Ad-hoc Query Support
						MongoDB has a very advanced feature for ad hoc queries. This is why we don’t need to worry about
						fore coming queries coming in the future.
						g. Easy Environment Setup
						It is easier to setup MongoDB then RDBMS. It also provides JavaScript client for queries.
						h. Full Technical Support
						MongoDB Inc. provides professional support to its clients. If there is any problem, you can
						directly reach a MongoDB client support system.

					<h4 style="color:#1a6091">Disadvantages</h4>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Transactions</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Joins</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Limited Data Size and Nesting</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Duplicates</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">High Memory Usage</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						- Transactions
						One of the downsides of MongoDB is that it doesn’t support transactions. Though fewer and fewer
						applications are requiring transactions, there are still some that need transactions in order to
						update multiple documents/collections. If that’s a necessary function for your team, MongoDB
						should not be used. There’s potential for data corruption.
						- Joins
						Joining documents in MongoDB is no easy task. Pulling data from several collections requires a
						number of queries, which will inevitably lead to messy code and long turn-around times.
						- Indexing
						MongoDB offers high-speed performance with the right indexes. In case if the indexing is
						implemented incorrectly or has any discrepancies, MongoDB will perform at a very low speed.
						Fixing the errors in the indexes would also consume time. This is another one of the major
						limitations of MongoDB.
						- Limited Data Size and Nesting
						MongoDB allows a limited size of only 16 MB for a document. Performance nesting for documents is
						also limited to only 100 levels.
						- Duplicates
						Another one of the major limitations of MongoDB is the duplication of data. The limitation makes
						it difficult to handle data sets as the relations are not defined well.
						Eventually, the duplication of data may lead to corruption.
						- High Memory Usage
						MongoDB requires a high amount of storage due to the lack of joins functionalities which lead to
						the duplication of data. There is an increase in data redundancy which takes up unnecessary
						space in the memory.
